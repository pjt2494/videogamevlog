            It was a week ago when I decided to finally buy a PS4, and along with it the Spider-Man game
             that a lot of people said was a fantastic game. But it was more than that. At least to me.

            For the past year I have been in a slump of video games. I would turn on my PC and start playing
             a game then 20 minutes later shut it down because I just wasn't feeling it. For some reason video 
             games just became meh for me. I have no idea why. But when I picked up Spider-Man and played it,
              memories from the PS1 Spider-Man flooded my head. I was actually enjoying this game. It brought
               some sort of spark back into my life with video games. I couldn't put it down; playing four hours
                every day for the next week.

            This game was the perfect example of a linear open world game. I wanted to 100% the game, 
            collect everything I could possible. Swinging through NYC was a blast. There was so much 
            combat options that I could literally fight in unique ways nearly every encounter. 
            The story was a slow burn, yet so much happened. And the ending. The ending had 
            no business being that sad, yet satisfying. This game was so unique and beautiful
             that I once again have a burning passion for video games and I hope that passion burns for a long time.
