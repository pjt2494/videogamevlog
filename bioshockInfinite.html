            I loved Bioshock Infinite's story. There's really two threads here. The main thread is this 
            floating world Comstock created. Most of the game is discovering the religion, history, and 
            politics of Columbia as it happens around you. The audio tapes play a large role in this,
            but it comes out in the gameplay as the idyllic scene breaks down into revolution. 
            A majority of the story occurs outside of a cutscene, which can be difficult to 
            process when there's a voiceover during a firefight or just exploration in general.

            The pretense of the story is that you're rescuing Elizabeth to clear your debt.
             This is important because without this task, Booker has no reason to be in Columbia. 
             The population living there are all entrenched in this bizarre culture. 
             Now the player gets to experience everything as an outsider, 
             which is totally different from someone who grew up in this circus town. 
             Finally, you get this last epic moment that transcends Comstock/Columbia 
             and links Infinite with 1 and 2. Booker wasn't a random outsider; he was fated to be there all along!

            I think you could completely cut the ending and still have a solid story but what you're left with is a
             Bioshock that belongs with the other titles in mechanics only. When people praise Infinite's story, 
             I think they are talking about the way you have two seemingly unrelated plots across multiple games,
              and at the very last moment the game convincingly says, "hey, we dropped clues for you all along 
              that this was coming but you still didn't see it."
