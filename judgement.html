            If you've ever been intrigued by the Yakuza serie but don't want to go 
            through all the 6 (or 7?) of them, get Judgement.

            Story is amazing, cast is stellar (especially if you know the actors from Jdramas!),
             direction is movie-like, you play as an ex-lawyer turned private detective.
              It has all the positives from the Yakuza serie and more.

            The "detective" related gameplay is nothing special, but it's quick and painless,
             and it's intriguing to explore a crime scene because it might reveal some important
              details to understand better the overall story.

            There is an insane amount of content, plenty of minigames (the drone races could be a game in itself), 
            sidequests of all kind (ridiculous and non), romance (multiple)... 
            and you can take all of this at your own pace, jumping back and forth between main story
             ;and side content.

            If you suck at games like me, you can change the difficulty realtime.
             I set it to Normal for normal fights and Easy during boss/miniboss fights.
              Combat is very deep, there is a massive amount of combat skills you can
               learn based on the combat style you prefer to use, and I liked how some
                abilities make use of the environment around you (like the wall jump).
                 In the end I played it mostly for the story so I didn't really fully 
                 explored the depth of the combat system.

            It contains Japanese humor, oversexualization and some quests present Japanese-style ideologies
             which might be seen weird/offensive from a western audience point of view. If you are sensitive
              to these topics, you might want to skip this.
