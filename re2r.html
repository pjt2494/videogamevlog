            RE 2 has a really good story. It manages to bridge a great mix of a well written survival story,
             mixed with some high level action that brings up the urgency and pace of the story.
              But the story is not the main thing about this game, but it's atmosphere.

            RE2's atmosphere is just, perfect. The enemies and the sounds they make really put you on edge,
             combined with the scarcity of items (maybe not as much towards the end), and lighting.
              As you explore the various areas, you have a flashlight that literally lights 1/10 of the screen,
               but it works, works really well! It integrates you perfectly into the perspective of Leon and Claire.
                Even though it is a 3rd person game, it feels like a 1st person game.

            The voice acting also makes this atmosphere so much better. Yes, there is not much speaking,
             but whenever Leon says "What the" when seeing a zombie once in a while, it helps you immerse 
             yourself into the Raccoon City incident. Side note, I just find the name Raccoon City really bad,
              but also good.

            Gameplay I don't have much to say, other than that I found it perfect. Shooting mechanics are really good,
             inventory management always keeps you engaged whenever exploring, keeping in mind what you need or not,
              and the enemies always do something unpredicatble, like suddenly shift to the left when you are about 
              to lock on for a headshot. Oh, and Mr. X is one of the scariest chase enemies in gaming.

            Yeah, all in all, Resident Evil 2 Remake is a solid 10/10, in my opinion.
             Now, I can't wait to finish the other RE games that I have, which are REmake, RE4, and RE7!
