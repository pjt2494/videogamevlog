            The game has excellent qualities, one of them is the voice acting, different accents are common throughout the world,
             as well as city and character designs. From region to region, ways of speaking change based on real world
              cultures, characters clothing’s and layouts of cities change too. 
              Every city in the game is based on a real world culture; 
              there is an Italian city, a Greek city, Japan, China, France, and more.
               As a long time jRPG player (and RPG in general), is common to see cities in games design with
                the sole purpose of being there to assist the player; here is the weapon shop, and there is the item shop, 
                also this lonely house of an important NPC to progress the main quest; so welcome to this great city of 
                half a dozen people and 3 buildings. Dragon Quest XI is a bit different, every city is unique, 
                and designed in a way that it can be a functioning place; there is tons of houses that you can go inside,
                 they have beds, tables, sofas and everything that a person could need. While playing the game
                 I found myself eagerly waiting for the next city to explore because they were all beautiful.

            The main cast of characters starts pretty weak, as common for a jRPG you play as a silent protagonist 
            (I hate that so much) and the first party member that you find is the most lame one, 
            a thief with a good heart, very original. He guides you in the first few hours of the story 
            since your character can’t think or speak. Eventually you find the best characters in the game,
             Veronica and Sylvando are, in main opinion, the proper main characters of the game, 
             they have a personality, a backstory, motivations, and often lead the party from place to place in their
              journey. Despite me picking on other characters, they are all unique, good voice acting, 
              funny lines, and interactions that are fluid and natural carry them to be one of the best jRPG 
              cast in the last few years. Takes you a long time to find out more about their past, 
              which I think could be fed throughout the game instead of their having a big “reveal” 
              one after the other during the second part of the game but that doesn’t hit them hard enough 
              to be a problem.

            Now let us talk a bit about the bad; what this game succeeds in charm and details,
             it fails on its core essence, turn based combat and menus. I am a bit ashamed to admit that a few hours
              in I was feeling like quitting because of how infuriating the menus are. You have 2 separate menus;
               on Playstation, Triangle opens the main menu with Items, Equipment, Attributes, Magic, and Options;
                the button Options opens what I think is supposed to be a quick menu that has Craft, Quests, Call Horse.
                 That is all fine but there is some quick use skills that are not in the quick use menu; 
                 Fast Travels is on Triangle > Magic > MainCharacter > Zoom, and healing is on Triangle >
                  Info > Heal All (I discovered after 40 hours that you can use Triangle > Square to heal but still).
                   This weird separation of what the game thinks its important is unnecessary, 
                   why is fast travel not available directly when you open the map?
                    Why is quest and craft not just part of the main menu? More often than not,
                     I was opening one of them and oops, it is not here is on the other one, its just annoying.

            Overall, I still think Dragon Quest XI is worth playing, the story is cliché but the voice acting carries
             it well. The locations are not “whoa” material but their city design is enough to make you want to 
             explore the world, and the main cast is charismatic and unique enough to be likable. 
             Definitely worth picking up if you like more traditional jRPGs, 
             I don’t like rating games but I would give it a 7/10.
