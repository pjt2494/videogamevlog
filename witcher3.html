            I’ve never played a Witcher game before, nor have I journeyed into the world of the novels.
             Knowing nothing about the world, I was expecting a high fantasy universe of thrilling swordplay, 
             bombastic wizards, and heroes triumphing over evil. The Witcher 3 did indeed have all of those things, 
             but honestly, those were the low-points in my journey as Geralt of Rivia. The meat of the game lies
              in the “ordinary” NPCs – relationships between peasants and lordship, husbands and wives, fear and
               shame, and the reconciliation between justice and prejudice. The game deftly weaves these stories
                in as side-quests that offer more moral conundrum that the standard RPG fetch-this-item and
                 kill-this-monster quests. Which is a little ironic, since the point of being a Witcher is
                  to kill monsters, however CDPR does a fantastic job of making each quest fairly unique
                   – never missing an opportunity for world-building in the process.

            I will admit that I was not hooked during the tutorial area of White Orchard, but once I got a greater 
            peek at how the politics, both between nations and neighbors, worked, my interest was officially piqued.
             The first true area available in the game is Velen, the most beautiful swamp and bog-ridden video game
              land I have ever seen. The landscape perfectly represents its ruler(s) and people as well – brimming
               with dingy life, dirty and twisted. It sets up perfectly for the rest of the world. The vistas and
                areas do become more visually pleasing, but corruption still lurks under the surface. I honestly
                 think Velen is where the game works best, as you’re still trying to figure everything out in the 
                 main quest, but you are forced to run Witcher Contracts as well. You are dead broke, trying to
                  understand it all like everyone else. The only difference is that Geralt is a Witcher with his
                   swords.

            Novigrad is also a triumph as one of the best medieval cities I have ever seen in a game. 
            The streets really felt alive, and the inclusion of so many different areas like Hierarch Square,
             the docks, and Far Corners really helps immerse you in this town. The map, twisting and turning
              on itself through the buildings, also brings Novigrad to life in a way that many RPGs fail to 
              with their miniscule cities.

            The main quest, unfortunately, does not live up to the rest of the game. I am sure that a good portion
             of my distaste is because Witcher 3 is a sequel of a sequel of the books, but everything became much
              more esoteric the further along I progressed. Not much is offered in way of explanation of the Wild
               Hunt, and everything becomes over-the-top magic oriented. There are also some pacing issues which
                arise from the game giving the player false-expectations. Suffice to say, I was a little burnt 
                out after finally finishing the seemingly marathon sprint of the game’s last act.

            Part of this burn-out was also a result of the combat and leveling systems. The strength of the Witcher 3
             is its stories and characters, and the gameplay/combat is simply a means to experience these events. 
             So when the stories suffer, the other flaws begin to show. Geralt’s leveling system could use a focus
              on gaining new abilities rather than the generic “gain X damage,” “make X ability more powerful,” 
              and etc. Give me a different way to approach an enemy; maybe a leaping attack, or a disarm move, 
              or even some combos to pull off between the heavy and light attacks. Help me chain the signs and
               attacks together in some meaningful way. There are different attacks to unlock in the combat tree,
                but they don’t come until very late.

            In the same way, the enemies and world also become static after a while. Higher level enemies are the
             same as their ordinary counterparts, just with more health. They need different attacks or tactics 
             that differ from dodge-attack. Some of the best enemies in the game are the Rotfiends that require
              you to back away when you see they are preparing to explode, or the wraiths that require you to 
              use a sign to even deal decent damage to them. They represent a mix-up from the standard,
               vanilla combat that makes the encounters feel fresh and exciting. Even the world traversal 
               needs more work – more ways to approach an objective other than following a road. Let me climb,
                let me jump onto more things; let me fall further than 3 feet without dying instantly.
                 Why make a giant world and then not let me play with different ways of traversing it?

            These things converge into the main flaw of the game’s design for me – it’s stuck between an RPG 
            and an Action/Adventure game, indecisive as to which way to lean. The combat is a low-light in 
            the experience, and the RPG elements aren’t vast enough to meaningfully change the way the world 
            is experienced. The player is Geralt, and they will always be Geralt. There are different builds
             within the leveling system through prioritizing signs, combat, or potions, but at the end of the day,
              you’re still going to be fighting things with your two swords. The ability to unlock companions to
               travel with would be a wonderful way to deepen the interaction with the world and allow you to
                indirectly experience different types of combat while still staying true to Geralt.

            Overall, the Witcher 3 is with a deep and intricately crafted world of interesting stories, characters,
             and politics. Sure, the gameplay itself certainly has flaws, but the journey and experience outweighs
              those issues. The folktale-esque lore of the Witcher universe stands on its own as some of the best 
              in the fantasy RPG genre. I haven’t delved into the DLC just yet. I plan to, but before I do, my next
               step will be to journey into the world of the novels. I think that’s about the biggest compliment 
               I could give the Witcher 3.
