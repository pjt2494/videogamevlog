            This may be beating a dead horse, but I just finished Yakuza 0, and I'm amazed.
             I have heard about the series and even gave it a try back in the day with the original Yakuza, 
             but just gave up on it because there were other games I though I would like more. Picked this
              game up on a sale and I feel like i robbed the developers for just 5 dollars. I'm not huge
               into Japanese media so my expectations weren't that high but goddamn is this game just spectacular.

            First few chapters are weak and I feel like a terrible introduction to the series, I nearly gave 
            up on it once again, but a friend of mine advised me to push through and so I did. Each chapter 
            kept getting better and better, more minigames, more activities, the story, deeper combat.

            Story was truly amazing, I can recount at least 2 times when I almost shed a tear, every single character
             is written so well, even all the substory characters have uinque personalities, some of the minor
              characters are better written than main characters in other video games. By the end I felt something 
              I haven't felt since playing Witcher 3 for the first time, hollowness. The feeling of being empty 
              since I wanted more. I'm surely going to give Kiwami a try next, but my expectations now are sky high.

            Gameplay is pretty good, I felt some styles over-shadowed others on both Kyriu and Majima, breaker 
            style is completely broken, and if there are any bikes around when in Beast mode, that's it, game over.
             I really appreciated the fact that all the billions of yen you gather are mostly spent upgrading your
              abilites, as everything else was pretty cheap such as health items. I maxed out 2 styles, and money
               was basically endless by the end of Kyriu's and Majima's buisness stories.

            The substories had so much care in them, if you don't like reading though, that might be a problem.
             I really don't mind the japanese dubs as it adds to the experience, I even play the Metro games 
             in russian just for a better feeling of the world. Some substories had me laughing in tears, 
             other touched me emotionally, there's such a huge dyanmic of emotions I felt over the course
              of the game. The mini games are this series' bread and butter, they are all really well-made
               even if annoying like the catfighting mini game. Favorite has to be the cabaret club and the
                story along with it.

            Overall this game is a definite 10/10 for me, some minor nitpicks like the graphics, 
            the polygonated faces, the save system and the enemy radar which never worked properly, 
            but all these are outshadowed by what this game does great like the story, the gameplay,
             sidestories and all types of mini-games. You can be lost in Kamurocho and Sotenbori for 
             hundreds of hours (or at least I was) trying to complete everything. Even if you're not
              a fan of Japanese media like me, give this game a try, you won't regret it.
