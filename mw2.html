            To start, I give it a 7/10; dumb fun, well-acted, but has some problems.
            First off, it's pretty short. I had time Thursday and today to play it
             and ended up getting to the last mission a while ago. Now there's leaks
              that suggest a story DLC will come next year, and I hope so, because MAN 
              is it short. It says 17 missions total,but it feels like half of them 
              are really one mission split in half.

            The actors are all pretty good; Soap and Ghost get special mention for being charming dickheads,
             and Alejandro is a good addition to the cast.

            Writing...can be another story. It's CoD so it being simple is expected. 
            However by GOD do a lot of the antagonists suck in this game. You have terrotist man,
             who's the biggest black-hole of charisma and is more a plot device than an actual person. 
             Then you have the cartel, who's led by a lady whose moonlighting as an assassin,
              who gets found out in 5 min. after being on screen. Once you meet the leader, 
              after that mission they're another plot device, which sucks because it felt 
              like they were supposed to be a bigger player, and then weren't.

            However, the last group, Shadow Company are the highlights. Graves is an evil dude and he LOVES it,
             Shepard gives good lines even if he looks different now, and their banter in the background is
              pretty cool. I wish the story focused more on their stuff instead of the other groups.

            Gunplay is Call of Duty; it's good. The new armored enemies can be bullshit in certain levels up close,
             but FUCK the riot shield guys, they will kill you at least a couple of times. Missions range from 
             average to literally my favorite one in recent CoD memory. Seriously, Alone should have been a 
             multi-part section of the game with how cool it is.

             Overall, 7/10, wish it was longer and that the main villan didn't suck ass.
