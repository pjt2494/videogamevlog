            Now the story doesn't really matter here, it's a pretty generic stealth story.
             I don't even remember any of the characters besides Sam Fisher, but even then
              his only characteristics are Stealth, and looking like he is about to shit his
               pants without his goggles on. This also leads right into the next category
        </p></center>

            Surprisingly, the graphics actual hold up really well, especially for an Original Xbox title,
             though some stuff looks wonky, but it is very minute, like some of the facial animations,
              certain textures, etc. The only thing that stands out bad graphically is the cutscenes, 
              but those can basically be skipped as you aren't missing much story wise.

            Now this is the strong suit of the entire game, and is why it is so good. 
            The entire niche/gimmick of Splinter Cell is hiding in the darkness, and it works 
            amazingly with the level design. Now, the actual stealth is broken into 2 main parts,
             how much light there is, and how much noise is made. Both of these are shown as 2 bars
              in the bottom right, with one bar showing how visible Sam is, and the other showing 
              how much noise he is making, but also how much ambient noise there is, so like people
               talking, machinery, etc. Basically, you want to keep both of these bars down at zero or
                close to zero. The other main gameplay mechanic is Sam's night vision goggles, which 
                help you see in the dark, though also have 2 other settings (which are only really used in like 2 levels),
                 infrared and electrovision(forgot what it is called). With these 3 gameplay mechanics combined, 
                 it makes for super in-depth stealth, but with then the level design, it works even better.

            Now, Getting to the level design, they are all both similar in some areas, but also entirely different
             in others. They are similar in how all of them will basically be broken up into hallways/corridors
              that lead into bigger more open areas, and then back into corridors. They are different however
               in that each level has 1 or 2 gimmicks for it. For example, the boat level is flooded in certain 
               areas/has certain lights that can't be shot out/shut off. Another example is the Japan level, 
               which has walls that can be cut through, and many, many candles.

            Very quick side tangent, but the game has co-op, where you play entirely new levels with different
             challenges and such but with a buddy. I think it also has online multiplayer, but I believe it was
              shutdown and is unplayable.
