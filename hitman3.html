            Nothing I’ve played when I was younger gave me quite the same feeling as the first Hitman games.
             I loved going around the levels coming up with different ways to fulfil my assassination contracts, 
             and I was always impressed by the freedom you got when playing them in terms of what was possible.
              To this day I have very fond memories of Contracts, Blood Money and especially Silent Assassin.

            Fast forward to 2022 and I find myself playing the reboot for the first time and loving it even more than the 
            originals. 2016’s Hitman is a fantastic return of a standout franchise, and to me its greatest achievement
             so far. It’s one of those rare cases in which nostalgia actually takes a back seat in favour of something new,
              because of how well executed that something new is. There isn’t much I’d change about the reboot, 
              even though as a patient gamer, it’s hard to separate what was originally released with the game and what
               came as part of the confusing Hitman 3 integration.

            The amount of freedom in approach every single mission affords you is the stuff of legends.
             This is easily one of the most deliberately repayable games I’ve ever experienced,
              in that it doesn’t only encourage you to try different approaches to missions, 
              it is literally designed to make you replay them. The game boasts fantastic level design, 
              with big open sandboxes on every single mission and lots of agency and interconnected goodness 
              in its systems. I would absolutely consider Hitman an immersive sim because of this,
               even if 2 of the genre’s main aspects (that you don’t have a 1st person mode and can’t 
               complete a mission without killing) aren’t present.

            The AI is, for the most part, incredibly competent, which makes those few moments where you
             can see the cracks in the illusion the game is trying to sell even more jarring.
              The stylish, cinematic presentation hits another high note. I went in kind of blind and didn’t 
              expect much in this sense, but I loved how the surprisingly engaging story was weaved into the
               masterfully animated and voiced cutscenes, and I also really enjoyed the feel you got from every
                single mission briefing and ending. The whole thing just gave out vibes of a refined espionage
                 tale of epic proportions that sticks with you for a while. To top it all off, the game is
                  visually impressive, with all scenarios looking and feeling different.
                   Sapienza was my personal favourite form an aesthetic point of view.

            When all is said and done though, 2016’s Hitman still stands as one of the most accomplished
             simulations I have ever played, and my personal highlight in the entire franchise.
              If none of the issues above are deal breaking to you, there is definitely a lot
               to love here and a ton of hours of fun to be had with all the replayability the game offers. 
               As someone who barely ever replays games these days, 
               I could easily recommend Hitman based on that alone. 8.5/10
