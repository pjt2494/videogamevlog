            What I love about this game is that it demands the player use their eyes, ears, and common sense
             to figure things out based on what they know about the world and what would make sense in real
              life rather than simply telling the player exactly what they're meant to do while holding their
               hand with UI.

            For example, when someone asks you to go to a certain location and dig something (or someone) up, 
            getting a spade is entirely on you. Or small details like the difference between stealing and not
             stealing: taking someone else's property without permission is stealing, but if your caretakers 
             leave bread on the table for you for when you wake up, taking it isn't stealing.

            Then there's the fact that NPCs in the game have virtual lives and aren't just handing around waiting
             to give you quests. Go to an NPC at a late hour and not only will they be in bed, they'll tell you to 
             fuck off for bothering them. It's implied that you should go to bed too and come back in the morning.
              The same goes for shopkeepers: sometimes they're not at their shop even though it's working hours.

            This is what an RPG should be like, to me. Kingdom Come isn't the first to do these things but 
            it's the most grounded RPG I've played, personally, and it feels like a home cooked meal in 
            comparison to Ubisoft's fast food open worlds or all the WoW clones out there that keep
             refining mechanics ripped from DoD that persisted in the past due to technical limitations 
             more than a lack of vision.

            I really hope this sets off a new trend. I'd love to see similar mechanics even in games with different
             genres. The act of grounding games to add immersion doesn't make them more hardcore or niche like 
             people think it does; the fact that Kingdom Come, Star Citizen, and even PUBG to an extent did so
              well demonstrate that there's a huge demand for games that respect the player's intelligence and
               know that fun doesn't always mean shooting someone every three seconds.
