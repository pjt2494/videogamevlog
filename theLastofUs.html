            Gameplay/Presentation: The biggest complaints I've seen is that its the same as the first game 
            and doesnt bring anything new. And while I don't think thats entirely true I can at least understand
             where people are coming from. However, playing these two games very different experiences.
              I played TLOU directly before playing TLOU2, my playthroughs even overlapped a bit and the 
              elevation of essentially the same mechanics is impressive. I understand the first game is much,
               much older, but I remember even during my initial playthrough it still 'felt like a video game'.
                A damn good video game, but it still had laggy NPCs, rough cuts between gameplay and cutscenes,
                 standard animations and standard combat.

            TLOU2 had the most intense, impactful and desperate gameplay I've ever experienced. 
            And all of that without adding tons of new features and mechanics and overwhelming us 
            with controls and systems. It's a simple game and its perfect.
        </p></center>

            Every bullet feels impactful and important. Every encounter dripping in suspense. 
            No game I've every played has just felt this good. Uncharted 4 is close, but still felt 'video gamey'. 
            This game grounded in reality without feeling sluggish. I love RDR2, but it did feel sluggish a bit. 
            Ellie is agile, fast and deadly, but doesnt feel like a buffed game hero. Eventhough the NPC's AI is
             far from groundbreaking, no other NPCs have felt more human. Beyond calling each other by name 
             (which was amazing), they just felt way more like real people than killing targets. 
             The melee animations, exposition power, red mist, blood splatters, body fragments are 
             all far beyond anything else I've seen in a game.
        </p></center>

            What really stood out to me beyond the incredible action was how smoothly everything was presented.
             The transitions from cut scenes to gameplay to quick time events was effortless. The best by far 
             was the camera transitions from Abby after being cut down by Lev and Yara, to facing into the forest
              with infected running out of the darkness. Holy Shit. Each melee weapon had unique and brutal 
              animations that transitions seamlessly in and out of live gameplay. And not a single time was
               I ever distracted during cut scenes by the immersion breaking thought of ''these are game 
               characters talking". This is a game that's presentation, story telling and combat were 
               executed at the highest level.

            I know pretty much everyone agreed the graphics and level building were fantastic, 
            so I won't spend a lot of time on them. My biggest take away here was just how detailed 
            and moody every single scene was. Even when I knew there were no enemies around, 
            I was still on the edge of my seat just from the eerie feeling every scene gave me. 
            By far the best looking and moodiest game I've ever played.

            So no, this game didnt revolutionize combat, or add anything beyond crawling and tall grass to stealth,
             but I don't think it needed to. It felt exactly like the original game but elevated to the highest 
             level of quality possible. I wasn't worried about controls or systems or mechanics, 
             I was worried about getting shot in the face or stabbed in the back by ruthless enemies,
              which was far more engaging than some new feature. They kept it simple and fucking nailed it.

            I've seen people mad about everything from Joel being killed and that it's just a basic,
             boring revenge story, to hating having to play as Abby and anger Ellie let her live at the end.
              They claim the writing was 'dogshit' and a 'dumpster fire' and how they ruined all the characters 
              people loved from the first game and this could not be further from reality.

            This game contains arguably the best story-writing I've ever experienced in a game.
             We praised Game of Thrones for killing Ned in season one as daring, unique and exciting
              and then bash this game for doing essentially the same? Killing him was brilliant.
               It made us feel the game, not just play it. From the very beginning we hated Abby 
               for killing someone we loved and seeing what it did to someone else we love, Ellie.
                Heading to Seattle to seek revenge felt overwhelmingly justified, fuck Abby! I couldn't
                 wait to take down her and anyone who got in my way, WLF, Scars, the infected, to hell with
                  all of them.
        </p></center>
        <br>

            The only thing more brilliant than killing Joel, was forcing us to play as his killer. 
            Games (and many movies) paint the bad guy as an evil villain who only 'wants to watch the world burn'. 
            Not often enough are we given a chance to understand the 'villain', and to learn they really arn't
             a villain at all. It doesn't take long to realize Joel is as much a villain in Abby's eyes, 
             as Abby is a villain in Ellie's eyes. This is not a world of heroes and villains, of good and evil. 
             This is a world where morality hangs in the gray and even the right answers may be the wrong ones. 
             The moral ambiguity was perfectly executed.
        </p></center>

            After Ellie's Day 3 and it was time to play as Abby, I was so conflicted between hating her and knowing 
            I needed to make her survive in order to continue the game. It didn't take long for me to realize she's 
            not an evil person, like, at all. Flashbacks showed a girl who loved her dad and her boyfriend, who was
             light hearted and caring. When she was being hung by the Scars I felt empathy and protective over her.
              The way she treated Yara and Lev initially made sense as they saved her, but going back for them on
               her own the next day showed something else; genuine human compassion. She couldn't just leave these
                children alone on their own. There was certainly an element of her needing to do some soul saving
                 after brutally murdering Joel, but that wasn't all of it. Saving the kids is what her father 
                 would have expected of her.

            When we are forced to hunt Ellie down in the theater after Jesse is killed, shooting at and 
            stalking Ellie was as an eerie experience as creeping through buildings of infected. I hated
             doing it, because I'm still on Ellie's side overall, but more importantly, I understood Abby
              for doing it. I felt justified hunting down a character I love while playing as one I have
               mixed emotions about, but understand. What other game puts you in such a moral dilemma?!
        </p></center>

            I was furious with Ellie for leaving Dina and the baby to hunt Abby down, a year later 1000 miles away.
             Why Ellie?! Just let it go, you won, you're alive, you're loved and you have a family and a farm house. 
             Abby was never going back after Ellie and Ellie knew that. By the time I was hunting my way through 
             Santa Barbara, I suddenly felt the same sense of reluctance I had felt as Abby hunting Ellie down. 
             I didn't want to kill Abby anymore. Within a few hours of game play my feelings and emotions towards
              and with two characters had shifted dramatically multiple times. As soon as I saw what 'the pillars'
               I wanted to kill Abby even less, in fact, I wanted to save her. When they were making their way to
                the boats and Ellie appeared to be just getting in her own and leaving, I was relieved. Just let it 
                end Ellie. When she turned and forced Abby to fight I was mad at her. And when she finally let Abby 
                up from drowning and let her go, I couldn't have been more proud of Ellie.
        </p></center>

            Revenge doesnt really solve anything. It doesn't bring Joel back, or Abby's father.
             It's a lose-lose for everyone involved. This game took me from angerly hunting down a 
             'villain' and killing anything that stood in my way, to being relieved to let her go by the end. 
             That. Is. Incredible. This game put us on an emotional roller-coaster and cut the breaks and
              I have never been more sad a game ended.

            I loved Joel, but both Ellie and Abby are far more interesting characters.
             And just like Game of Thrones, the uncertainty of the future is far more
              interesting with Ned, or Rob Stark dead than them leading the charge against evil. 
              We've had enough Joel Millers, Nathan Drakes, Arthur Morgans, etc. I love those guys,
               but we've been there and done that. Abby and Ellie open up a whole new world of incredible,
                relatable and deeply complex characters we havn't been able to experience enough yet.

            This game is a shining masterpiece of story telling, emotion, internal conflict and perspective 
            and I cannot wrap my mind around seeing this is a failure, dumpster fire or a story than 
            ruined characters we love.

            I don't want to get into arguments, but I am genuinely interested in why people didn't like this game,
             or hated it other than ''its trash and they ruined everything, what a failure". 
             Explain yourselves, please, I am soo curious.
