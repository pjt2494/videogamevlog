            I don't know that I've ever played a game quite like Nier Automata. To try and sum it up in one sentence,
             Nier Automata is an action RPG/hack 'n' slash game set in the far future on Earth where androids are
              doing battle with alien robots. But really, the game is so much more than that as it blends those
               elements with twin stick shooting, side scrolling action, and bullet hell sections that don't feel 
               out of place in a game that constantly works to subvert your expectation of what kind of game
                you're playing.

            The story starts out fairly straightforward: sometime in the distant past aliens attacked Earth
             and humans fled to the moon where they fight an ongoing war to reclaim the planet via androids.
              You play an android sent to Earth to fight against alien machines and liberate the planet. 
              As the game progresses you are exposed to multiple scenarios that begin to hint that the
               machines are actually forming consciousness and experiencing "life."

            It is in this discovery that the plot to Nier Automata truly shines. The androids, who unquestionably consider themselves to be alive,
             have no problem slaughtering the unfeeling machines. But as you learn that the machines may indeed be alive it throws your actions 
             and purpose for being on the planet into a morally gray area that the game wants you to confront. Throw in some plot twists along 
             the way and by the end of the game I was on the edge of my seat as I wanted to see how the story ended.

            The story is told in three acts, each time focusing on a different android. Completing each act actually triggers
             the credits and is considered an ending to the game. It is important to know that you should keep playing after
              the first ending as I really don't think the story picked up until the second act. The game does have a pop up
               telling you to continue playing, which was good because I was a little disappointed when I saw the credits 
               roll the first time and didn't really feel like anything had been accomplished.

            The first two acts play out over the same time and events but from different perspectives. 
            You'll see some of the same events but there are enough differences that it doesn't feel like a 
            cheap way to extend the playtime of the game. I actually found the swap really engaging and thought
             it was a neat way to use two characters to tell a full story. The third act then places you in
              control of a final android and picks up where the first two acts ended.

            There are actually 26 different endings to Nier Automata, but only the first five are considered real endings.
             The rest of the endings are sort of joke and/or bad endings that can happen based on decisions you make during
              your playthrough. For example, one of the endings you get by walking away from the assigned mission as soon as
               you take control of your character.

            Even with it's shortcomings I still really enjoyed my time playing Nier Automata. I was honestly surprised when I checked my
             game time and saw it was over 40 hours, it certainly didn't feel like I spent that long playing this game. The story is
              captivating and original and the way the game refuses to be confined to a single genre ultimately allows Nier Automata 
              to overcome some shortcomings in the combat and exploration.
