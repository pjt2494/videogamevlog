            So I finally got around to playing this on the PS5. I beat it with a little over 40 hours played while
             completing a fair bit of side material. Honestly I’m a little disappointed based on the massive amount
              of positive critical and user feedback this game received. Hell it’s still at a 9.1 user score on
               Metacritic. Which is to not say it’s a bad game. It’s not. It’s gorgeous and it’s fun. The main 
               characters are for the most of part decently well written and voice acted. The gameplay is repetitive
                however it’s passable. What it isn’t however is something demonstratively different than what 
                UbiSoft produces on a yearly basis. And UbiSoft gets universally panned by gamers and critics
                 alike for pumping out the same derivative mechanics this game is built upon.

            This game, for all the bluster about being one of the best open world games ever made,
             is just not anything approaching the top titles in the genre. In my opinion.
              Other than it’s art direction, which is fucking incredible… seriously I’ve taken more on game screens 
              of this than any game I’ve ever played… It’s Asassins Creed Odyssey in Japan. 
              Except it doesn’t have boats and there is a lot less variety in gear and specialization options.

            It’s the same bloated, empty world. There are like 5 resources to collect, a handful of wildlife species 
            (3 of which give you “predator hides”, the only usable resource from any of them), and a bunch of cut and 
            paste temples, hot springs, fox dens, etc. The only dynamic thing that ever happens is the same random
             encounter with a handful of Mongolians with a tied up peasant to rescue. The enemy encampments all look
              the same, just cut and pasted across the map. Seriously that’s it. I have zero desire to go play the DLC.
               The world is beautiful however it’s completely empty and devoid of meaningful or compelling things to do.
                Other than some new skills the game is exactly the same at the 5 hour mark as it is at the 40 hour mark.
                 Nothing in the game after the initial wonder of the look of everything wore off has surprised me.

            The best games in this genre that I have played, I didn’t want to end. 
            Red Dead 2’s world I got lost in for dozens of hours at a time without touching main story missions.
             Hunting and fishing, trying my hand at crime or gambling, seeking out legendary animals… 
             just exploring the land which was always a reward in and of itself. The Witcher 3 shares a lot of
              the same bloat that Asassins Creed and Ghost have however it made up for it by incredibly deep,
               rabbit hole like side quests that sometime lasted hours and took me places I never expected to go.
               And the story was great. Breath of the Wild consistently blew me away with creative mechanics, 
               puzzles and one of the greatest video game environments ever created. I’m still finding things
                to do in Skyrim 10 years on and enjoying myself. There is no way in hell I’m booting Ghost of
                 Tsushima up in 2032.

            This game has none of that. It’s fun, I don’t regret playing it, the main story is fairly compelling 
            however I just don’t see how or why this game received the near universal praise that it did.
