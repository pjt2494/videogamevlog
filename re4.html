            Video Games are probably one of the greatest artforms of our generation and Shinji Mikami is one
             hell of an artist, redifining the horror canvas twice. Thrice if like me you love Evil Within 
             1.Resident Evil 4 is probably my favourite resident evil game, not for the horror but for the
              action elements and how much it still holds up better than most other third person shooters
               even now. It's like a non stop roller coaster ride from start to the finish with over the 
               top cheesy lines and action sequences, which sees you hand to hand fighting with a former 
               comrade and being chased by a giant napoleon looking robot statue. Also I love Leon, dude 
               is a total badass.

            Story-Leon S. Kennedy, the s stands for stylish btw is a former cop and currently a secret Service agent
             sent to retrieve the daughter of the president of the USA armed with only a measly pistol and a can
              of first aid spray. What follows is just as weird as it is over the top. We get to fight the Big Cheese,
               meet a fellow "cop" And some larger than life villains. The story is better experienced than it is said.

            Gameplay-The bread and butter of the game. It's way too much fun popping heads like watermelons, 
            kicking enemies into oblivion, shooting their knees and then suplexing them. The game runs on tank
             controls and it's very easy to get used to after a while. You won't be moving and shooting, 
             so to compensate the enemies move slowly and shuffle towards you. However their attacks hit hard.
              The game also has adaptive difficulty which depending on your pov is a good or bad thing. 
              I died 40 times on normal difficulty since the enemies almost used to one shot me and I still had 
              a accuracy of 91%.On my professional run I died only 28 times 8 of them being qtes busted due to 
              playing the game on 60fps.The guns in this game are a joy to fire. The satisfying crunch of a
               parasite head exploding from a rifle shot is too damn satisfying.

            Graphics-The game still holds up in my opinion but man oh man I can't recommend the Re4 hd project
             mod enough. It's like an unofficial remaster made by like one man over many years. It's just way
              too gorgeous and adds many qol improvements like increasing the fov and disabling the film grain.
               It also fixes a few broken qtes.

            The only thing I genuinely hated was the last stretch of running to the final boss because the game 
            just kept on pouring enemies and that got tedious when even a single enemy can bring you to a near
             death state.

            Tl;dr-Play it, it's like the pinnacle of horror action games. The game is not typical RE game.
             It's absolutely not scary but 11/10 in the action and cheese department.
