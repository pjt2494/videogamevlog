        <center><p>I played Prey (2017) just after it released and really didn't know what to expect,
             I read that it had some cool weapons and crafting mechanics so I gave it a try... Oh My Goodness... 
             it's incredible! I have now completed 5 full playthroughs and even created some mods for the game
              as well as helping others create or improve mods. It is genuinely one of the most immersive,
               jaw-dropping, captivating games I have ever played, I adore it, and it regularly goes on sale 
               for under £$€5 which is the bargain of the century.

            "It's too difficult!!" - Look, it can be a little challenging at the start because you're a pathetic weak
             human facing some unknown superior species, what do you expect. The game does get much easier as you
              progress - you learn your enemies weaknesses, you get stronger - in fact, the most common complaint 
              I've seen is the game gets too easy towards the end, which it does in my opinion, that's why 90% of
               all mods for the game are to make it More challenging not easier, my mod dramatically increases the
                overall difficulty and it's still a bit too easy towards the end for my liking.
            If you find it too hard at the start I urge you to Not quit or lower the difficulty but instead
             try changing how you approach it, running and gunning doesn't suit every game so try sneaking or
              distraction, there are always multiple ways to do something or get somewhere, find an alternative 
              route or sometimes just accept that maybe you aren't strong enough to enter that area yet and it 
              might be done that way on purpose so you enter that area or get that thing later in the game when
               it would benefit you the most.

            It's repetitive (backtracking)" - What singleplayer game isn't a little repetitive? Would you prefer 
            a linear game where you can't explore or if you miss something you can never go back?
            Yes, you will need to backtrack sometimes to progress or to find things that might help you but it's
             not repetitive in my opinion, there's no Skyrim-Esque carbon copy fetch quests whereby only the NPC,
              object, and/or location changes but it's essentially the same exact quest, each objective whatever
               it might be has a purpose, it's too give you options, lead you places you might have ignored, it 
               has an effect on the end game.

            OK, I've already cut out large parts of this review because I hit Steam's review character limit,
             I could sit here for hours typing about it... it's just incredible. It's such a shame that it didn't 
             get the attention it deserved and is so underrated because of the name and people assuming it was a 
             sequel. It really is one of my top 10 favorite games of all time. Maybe it won't be for you but that's
              OK everyone is different, however, for me, it is truly one of the most immersive, captivating,
              mind-blowing games I have ever played.
