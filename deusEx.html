                I've always heard about how Deus Ex is supposedly one of the best games of all time and since 
                I enjoyed Deus Ex: Human Revolution when I played it I always wanted to go back and play the 
                original but the fact that it's ancient was putting me off since old PC games need hours upon 
                hours of patches and fixes. Surprisingly there was not a lot needed to get the game in working condition,
                 and that was the first sign that this game that came out 22 years ago is better than so many modern titles.

                The gameplay in this game is superb, you really feel like this badass supersoldier with a bunch of powers.
                 The game can be accomodated to any playstyle, lethal, non-lethal, guns blazing, stealth. 
                 I tried different things on each mission and all the playstyles were fun.
                  At first I tried being non-lethal and sneaky but at some point I just said fuck it 
                  and I had just as much fun.

                The level design deservers so much praise. I though games like Dishonored and
                 Deus Ex: Human Revolution had good design but ooooooh brother. 
                 This game blows everything out of the water, so many ways to traverse levels, 
                 so many secrets, so much lore hidden in every level, it's astonishing how this
                  game came out in 2000 when it feels like it should be what comes out today. 
                  Every level was a joy to play through, I expected something akin to Vampires 
                  The Masquerade where the game is amazing early on but the later levels decrease in quality,
                   but no, all the leves are consistently great to amazing.

                The world building is spectacular for a game with a game area much smaller than the likes 
                of RDR2 and with so little NPCs. It feels lived in, it feels like it's a vision from the future
                 of what would actually happen. It takes these real life conspiracy theories and applies them 
                 to the world to make it stand out among it's other immersive sim companions.
                  All the characters felt somewhat realistic, there was no clear evil corporation.
                   The Majestic 12 are doing what The Illuminati did but granted to an extreme JC Denton
                    is also a pretty good protagonist as he isn't a blank slate but he also isn't too over the top
                     and doesn't talk much outside of NPC conversations (as it should be).
                      I'd say I prefer him to Adam Jensen

                The soundtrack is phenomenal, cyberpunk soundtrack done right, everything fits.
                 The actual gunplay is realistic somewhat and I really like it. The inventory system that
                  I would presume is borrowed from the Resident Evil games works perfectly.
                   There is nothing bad about this game, I could nitpick about the graphics
                    (the facial animations are actually still quite good), the control scheme
                     (that could be changed) and how the game's lightning is made with bats in mind 
                     (but it could be tweaked with a DX12 patch), but all these are a given for such an old game
                      and I could really see how in 2000 and even now it would be considered as one of the best 
                      of all time.

                Overall, I expected to like this game, I did not expect to love it and experience freedom on this level.
                 I 100% like this game better than Human Revolution and I'm kind of scared to go into Mankind Divided
                  now cause this game set the bar so high, I believe too high. Once again, this game has no bad qualms 
                  about it so a 10/10 is in order.
