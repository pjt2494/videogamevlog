            Campaign-The open world elements was breathtaking, the way Zeta Halo positions itself in the outer cosmos
             was wild to me, the setpieces were really good and felt so alive just going our in an open world
              environment. The Banished were a shear foe to face and gave a tough challenge with how limited
               the UNSC was after they stormed the Infinity. The bosses in the game while not exactly
                impressive were engaging and fun to fight. The missions were good at best but still 
                not really rememberable. The Road was a really really well made level, using Sheila
                 (the Scorpion tank) to the House of Reckoning was an overjoyed time. There were a lot
                  of moments with too many enemies and getting to the end was tough even on Normal or Heroic.

            Once we got in, I instantly knew what was gonna go down, a complete redo of the original Firefight 
            system by Bungie, it was so fun to fight waves after waves, but I really didn't like facing the Hunters,
             they could block most shots and had insane amounts of health as I believe. The Grunts are always fun 
             to fight and birthday party is still funny asf. Skirmishers returned and being a Halo Reach fan was 
             so nostalgic to me.

            However, on my note from before, the bosses are just not that great, Chak Lok and Myriad are good choices
             for good fights but so underused they don't show as a serious threat, you can use threat sensor and a
              bulldog on Chak Lok and kill him in minutes but Myriad can just blown up by a bunch of rockets or
               Needlers. But that's my thoughts on them. Escharum was quite an odd character, his arc made some sense
                in some areas like the whole Doisac getting blown up but the way he's presented is quite mid-tier.
                 His boss fight really encapsulates what a boss should be for me. The fact he can have a shield was
                  interesting and shows that "oh Chief can't always punch his way out, time for a new strategy." 
                  The Harbinger wasn't a good fight, you had to fight other enemies and wait for an opening for her
                   to come out and wasn't a big fan of the waiting game, not to mention the Chieftains, way too
                    powerful imo. But overall it was a good time, definitely one of my favourite campaigns along 
                    with Reach and Halo 2, maybe even Halo 4. I liked it, was a great time and had plenty of fun,
                     waiting on coop. 8/10
