                I have easily put in about well over 150 hours into this game and I have finally beaten the 
                game last night. I'd like to point out some cons or flaws I saw with this game from the production
                 side of things, the hype, and the gaming experience. I did enjoy a good bit of it, but yet I do feel 
                 like this wasn't FromSoftware's best attempt compared to its predecessors and a lot of things feel 
                 so lazily put together or totally ignored by the developers.

                First experience, I managed to buy Elden Ring on PS5, Series X, and PC. Firstly, from the get-go,
                 there were issues with not being able to access online on Series X for a good while.
                  So, then I switched to the PC version where I experienced the WORST optimization from a launch game
                   in a long time. It was just totally unplayable with frame rate drops and freezes that
                    I just had to quit as it became totally unplayable. This was also being ran on a PC with a 3700X
                    , 32GB of RAM, a RTX 3080, and plenty of bandwidth and good download and upload speeds
                     to be able to stand up to the task.

                I think a lot of people who have started this game or who have put a lot of hours into can attest to this:
                 the game feels like it gets so repetitive and there is no real reward other than a new spell or weapon 
                 to use to go onto the next boss and rinse and repeat the process until you finally beat the game.
                  Elden Ring just doesn’t feel like it has the lore that Dark Souls did. Bosses in this game also 
                  feel cut and dry too. I don’t understand the reason to face the SAME boss 3-4 times in this
                   game or even as a duo. That just feels like they ran out of ideas. Some bosses just feel like 
                   they’re designed horribly, and most people just find a way to cheese them, and they become forgotten.

                A lot of you would simply disagree and say this game is easily a 10/10, but I think you guys really need
                 to siphon through this game with a fine-tooth comb. This game still has issues and feels unfinished 
                 in some areas. Is it a good game? Yes. Is it enjoyable? Yes. But, as a Souls veteran, 
                 I came away from this game feeling completely let down and like FromSoftware could’ve done
                  a much better job at what they gave us. I think a better story would have served everyone
                   well as well as having a better way to navigate where to go. I’m not asking for hand holding,
                    but when you go the route of an open world game, you spend A LOT of time looking at guides
                     online trying to figure out where to go which could be time spent in game getting to where
                      you need to go if you had a good sense of direction. To me,
                       the ending just felt very anticlimactic after the previous boss fights leading up to it.
                        This game has left me feeling like I don’t want to go through it again. 
                        I’m just annoyed and, in some ways, feel like I got much less of the experience I was hoping 
                        for, and I definitely feel like this game was overhyped a bit too much. Overall, with everything
                         considered, I’d give this a 10/10.
