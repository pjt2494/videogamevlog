                If you come to God of War Ragnarök hoping for a story that's as tightly focused and emotional
                 as its predecessor, you're likely to come away disappointed. But if you go in looking for 
                 a well-written and well-acted romp with the same kind of high-impact, tactical action combat 
                 as the 2018 game, you'll come away with a smile on your face.

                There is nothing life-changing about the way Ragnarök wraps up, but it delivers the same pleasant 
                satisfaction that I get from finishing a Marvel movie that lets me run on autopilot. 
                Even where the game can be frustrating, rote, and uneven, it’s also safe and comforting,
                 like a rerun of Cheers where everyone knows your name and you know that you’ll never get 
                 thrown out of the bar. God of War Ragnarök, as the sum of its many disparate and often 
                 conflicting parts and influences, isn’t here to reinvent the wheel. But its single-minded 
                 desire to emulate all the hallmarks of an epic Hollywood narrative will remain both its 
                 biggest weakness and its enduring source of success. And like many, many Hollywood success stories, 
                 it shouldn’t feel this weird to say that something of this scope and scale is just OK

                God of War: Ragnarok is the perfect sequel. A carefully iterative offering that beautifully
                 maintains the essence of 2018's Game of the Year while making meaningful improvements to augment
                  its already stellar combat and progression systems, God of War: Ragnarok is a meaty and deeply
                   emotional epic that effortlessly secures its place as one of the best games on PS5 and a
                    sure-fire Game of the Year candidate.
