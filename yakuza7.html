            I got introduced to Yakuza franchise a year back and I started from) all the way to 6. 0 
            (which I gotta say is one of the best games I ever played) and Kiwami 2
            ( coz of Ryuji Goda- he had limited screentime and still overshadows Kiryu,Ichiban,Majima 
            or any of the protagonists Yakuza ever had ) are my fav and after finishing 6 ,
             I was pretty excited to play Like a Dragon as people consider it on par with 0.

            The biggest shock came to me when I saw it had turn based combat, I had been enjoying bashing people 
            heads on pavements and swinging motorcycles and to go to turn based was jarring but I pushed through
             and I really started to enjoy the game story and characters but the combat was testing my patience
              as the game throws way too many random encounters at you coupled with that combat system- it made me
               go insane just trying to run away from any random enemies everytime. With Kiryu I actively seeked
                fights because I loved bashing heads but in this game I actively ran away due to how tedious the
                 combat is and how long it takes to beat enemies sometimes. Then came chapter 6 and the godawful 
                 dungeon which kept on going and going and going. Thatâ€™s where I realized how much I enjoyed the 
                 Kiryu games over this slogfest.

            My second biggest gripe with the game was the grind and the movement system- yokohama is big like really
             freaking big but there is no actual way of fast travel? like the game got taxis but you have to actively
              seek for them and then unlock them and even then the story mission locations are too far from taxi
               stands and you get into another enemy counter just trying to reach the next mission. Not to mention 
               to change jobs you gotta travel all the way to Hello Work. Next is the grind- one thing I always
                appreciated about Yakuza games is that I rarely needed to grind unless you are a completionist.
                 I used to focus on story and do some side stuff and finish the game and move on to another entry.
                  But not with Y7- the game forces you to grind like hell- I hit a major roadblock at chapter 12 
                  and the game asked me to grind to get on the level of the bosses and the level spike was insane.
                   I was already disliking the combat and then this finally forced me to drop the game forever.

            I will say - The story and the characters are top notch. Ichiban is a cool character tho not cooler
             than Kiryu. His friends are really well written too, I loved their chemistry, banter and everything
              about them. I liked the wacky side stuff, Dragon Kart and Property management minigames.
               But the reason I fell in love with Yakuza in the first place was due to how I could just play 
               the story naturally and do some side stuff after coming tired from work and call it a day.
                I loved beating dudes up , grabbing them and bashing their heads on a wall or lifting a
                 bike and going full whirlwind with it.

            I know plenty of people like the combat and it bought a new fresh take on the series but this formula 
            is simply not for me- it changed everything I loved about Yakuza and made it worse atleast for me.
             Story,characters,side stuff are still top notch but the grind and the combat just don't hit with 
             me well. I am out of the Yakuza franchise for now and it saddens me I couldn't kept on going , 
             I badly wanted to see how the story end instead of watching it on youtube. I have completely lost
              interest in future Yakuza titles now and look forward to spinoffs as I believe there is nothing 
              like RGG games products on market. Thanks for reading.
