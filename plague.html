            Man, what an absolutely beautifully written story. The emotional connection between Amecia
             and Hugo is something you literally feel like you are part of it throughout the game.
              It tug at my heart so many times.

            Towards the end of the game there are scenes where their voice actors come 
            across so emotional themselves. Hugo's especially. There are some goosebump inducing scenes.

            The game is also absolutely beautiful. Some of the settings and areas you come across are gorgeous.
             It my opinion this game has some of the best looking environments I've seen on next-gen so far.
              I'm playing on PS5 by the way.

            They also improved the combat so much more from the first game.
             You are allowed to tackle scenarios however you want.
              You can still be 100% stealthy, or you can go all out with the combat.
               All the new weapons and items to use during combat are fantastic as well.

            And man, the end of the game is just so beautiful and emotional. 
            I literally had the goosebumps and could cry myself. 
            It honestly is probably the best game I've played all year. 
            I really hope it does get the recognition it deserves just because of the whole 60fps fiasco.

            Asobo Studios has made a masterpiece that improved in every
             way possible from the first game. And they deserve so much credit.
